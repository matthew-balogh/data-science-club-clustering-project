# Clustering Data and Visualizing in 2D

## Project Overview

![](./resources/overview.png)

## Background

In this project, from theoretical aspect, we will visit the following concepts:

- General Data Science pipeline
- Unsupervised learning
- Representation learning
- High-dimensional data characteristics
- Neural networks

We will overview the algorithms of:

- *K-means*
- *Self-Organizing Map (SOM)*

And we will use 2D visualizations to **explore**, **understand** and **explain** **patterns** in the data.

## Experimental details

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Cluster the dataset by *K-means*
3. Cluster the dataset by *SOM*
4. Cluster the dataset by some neural network approach
5. Compare the results through visualization and by evaluating unsupervised metrics
6. Refine the data and rerun experiment

Throughout the above steps, we will get hands on experience how unsupervised and representation learning works along with how to visualize high-dimensional data in a way that is interpretable for the human eye. At the end, we will connect how SOM relates to a neural network.

With all the steps documented, we will end up with a **concise** and **comprehensive report** that you can refer to in the future, along with the possibility to share our results via certain channels of the *Data Science Club*.
