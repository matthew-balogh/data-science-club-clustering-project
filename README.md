# Clustering Data and Visualizing in 2D

A project explored in [Data Science Club at ELTE](https://datasciencelte.netlify.app), 2025.

Coordinated by *Matthew Balogh* (✉️ matebalogh@student.elte.hu, 🐙 [matthew-balogh](https://github.com/matthew-balogh))

**Brief objective:** Group similar data points together and then visualize *where* and *how* those groups separate from each other and explore what characterizes them.

## Topics covered

1. Clustering **two-dimensional** data with *K-means*
2. Clustering **high-dimensional data**, while visualizing it in **2D** using *Self-Organizing Maps*
3. Touch up on how *Self-Organizing Maps* relate to neural networks

Our analysis will be accompanied by visualizations whether it is related to simple or high-dimensional scenarios.

Also, by visiting the above mentioned steps, we expect that by the end of the project we will have both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in the field of *Representation Learning*.

## Instructions to run the notebooks

```bash
# 1. install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run a selected `.ipynb` notebook from the project
```

## Documentation

Background information and experimental details are recorded in [Documentation.md](./Documentation.md).
